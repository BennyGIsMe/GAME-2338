## Summary

In this game you are a man named Desmond Miles in the 21st Century. He finds himself in a unfimailar place having been kidnapped by a company by the name of Abstergo industries. There they hook Desmond up to a machine called the Animus which allows one to traverse the memories of distant ancestors. Inside these memories Desmond "becomes" his ancestor named Altair, who lived in the 12th Century in Masyaf. Desmond's goal throught the game is findng out what Abstergo and these memories he's being forced to live through have in common. Through these memories you find out that Altair has succedded this mission; but by doing so ended up breaking the three tenets of the Creed causing him to be demoted to a novice. With no other choice the only way for Altair to regain is rank in the Brotherhood is to Assassinate 9 Key figures in the the Holy Lands of Jerusalem.

There is tons to do in this game, as you start out the overall goal is to rise through the brotherhood back to Altairs original rank. This is done by completeing a bunch of assassinations which are given to you by the leader of the Order. Altair's targets are in one of three cities in the Holy Land, When he arrives for the first time he must meet with a member of the Brotherhood. Altair learns basic info on his target from the Brotherhood member, but now you as the player have to do the rest of the recon. There are a couple ways to do this, you can eavesdrop, interrogate, meet with informants, or gather improtant items. Only after you gather enough information on your target, will they show themselves for you to assassinate.

Assassination is the game and in order to that you have to be stealthy, the game has a meter in the UI that informs you how noticible Altair is to those around him. The Abstergo logo changes shape and color depending on if your clear and no one notices you, or if they are getting suspicious, to they know who you are and are looking for you. When a area is on high alert because you came through and slaughtered a bunch of guards, the entire interface gains a red tinge and the Abstergo Logo is big and red. In order to reduce your notoriety you have to loose the guards line of sight and find a hiding spot. Hiding spots are all over the map and they will show up as a blue blip on your map as you are getting chased. You can also use Roaming scholars to blend with or just sit on a bench next to some lovely citizens.

## Final Thoughts

The coolest thing to me that you are able to do in game is "parkour". You can climb just about any building in game from bottom to top, you can also jump from building to building. When falling you can also catch ledges and pull yourself back up. I remember i would just run climb and jump for hours not even worrying about side quests and main missions. The other thing i really enjoyed was the combat because it allowed you to dump on everything when you got the timing right, no matter how many enimes were around you. So normally I would run up on a guard and kite them while running around the city pulling more guards in and when I had enough "Welcome to the Slaughter House" everyone perished. Then I would parkour myself to saftey and repeat. One thing I can say i didnt enjoy was the side missions. There are a handful of them but they are super repetitive which after a while get tiring so I stopped doing them altogether.

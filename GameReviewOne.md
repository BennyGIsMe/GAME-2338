## Summary

This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarizing the
game play mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what,
when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts

Describe in as much detail as possible what you did and didn't enjoy about the
game and list out your reasons why. Remember this is a review and thus should
stand up to some criticism when making your reasons why you thought this way
about particular features of the game. This should be at a minimum of 1
paragraph.

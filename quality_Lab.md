# Apex Legends
The two Quality factors that I believe Apex does well with are as follows. The first quality would have to be maintainabillity, I have been
playing this game since its release or season 0. Throughout this time there have been multiple bugs in-game, and even with the servers themselves.
However Respawn has done an excellent job in fixing or finding a solution for these bugs and continue to do so. The Second quality ill address is
Portability, For a while Apex was only played on PC, Xbox, and PS4 but, within this last year they came out with Apex for the Nintendo Switch and
did a beta test for mobile. It is pretty cool that they did that and it made a bunch of people confused thinking about how it would work.

# Destiny 2
I love the Destiny games first one was my favorite but, the second is still super fun. For this game the quality ill cover is going to be
Reliability. This game is a big loot shooter which turns very grindy fast. Which is great because its supposed to be. I love running around 
fighting bad guys and being rewarded for it, it also alows me to hone my skills which in turn lets me be a better player. This aspect of the game
has never changed and I hope it won't, in my opinion thats exactly what made me fall in love with the game.

# Dying Light
Dying light is a unique game as it brings parkore into the zombie fighting world. You can slide under stuff, climb walls, buildings, and Jump huge
gaps all while smashing in zombie heads. The quality factor ill talk about is usability, In dying light there is a ton of stuff you can do.
If there weren't any tutorials to help you along you wouldn't know if what you were doing is right or if you were missing something. Dying lights
tutorial is brilliant and really breaks things down. even when its done you can still go to the menu and look at it again.

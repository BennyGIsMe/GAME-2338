# Apex Legends
The two Quality factors that I believe Apex does well with are as follows. The first quality would have to be maintainabillity, I have been
playing this game since its release or season 0. Throughout this time there have been multiple bugs in-game, and even with the servers themselves.
However Respawn has done an excellent job in fixing or finding a solution for these bugs and continue to do so. The Second quality ill address is
Portability, For a while Apex was only played on PC, Xbox, and PS4 but, within this last year they came out with Apex for the Nintendo Switch and
did a beta test for mobile. It is pretty cool that they did that and it made a bunch of people confused thinking about how it would work.
